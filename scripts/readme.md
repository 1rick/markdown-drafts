#How to use this package

This is a shell script and applescript combo that will do three things:

1. create a new markdown file in the 'markdown-drafts' folder
2. and then open it in textmate
3. and then open the preview in marked

I recommend you drop the entire 'markdown-drafts' folder in dropbox. That's where I'm putting it, anyway.... But move the New_post.scpt file (or a copy of it) to your /LIBRARY/SCRIPTS/ folder so it can be run from your menu bar. You will also have to run (from terminal) chmod +x /Users/username/Dropbox/markdown-drafts/scripts/newpost.sh to make the shell script executable.
